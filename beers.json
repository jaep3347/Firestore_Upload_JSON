    "Description": "Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup.",

Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts.

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.20 IBU",

The combination of malts and hops creates a toasty, fruity flavor. Our ESB is dry hopped with a US grown hop varietal called Williamette, which has a pronounced spicy, lemon flavor.In the early 1970’s, brewers in London and the south of England expanded the range of beers available in pubs, reacting to the wave of European lagers moving into the British pub scene. In addition to the ordinary bitters and pale ales, brewers developed recipes for stronger premium ales like ESB, special bitter and special pale ale. These beers contributed to the English traditional ale revival of the 1980’s, making their way into the beer portfolios of many American craft breweries.30 IBU",

In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.",

The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste.

This Doppelbock Dunkel from Bavaria’s Holy Mountain presents a pleasant effervescence. And then there’s the unmistakable flavour: mouthcoating and velvety, strong and yet pleasantly malty – a powerful, robust body. At the same time, it develops an easily recognisable sweetness, embraced in roasted cocoa and a light, bitter hoppiness.Concluding with a powerful punch, this Doppelbock departs with a lingering aftertaste of quality plain chocolate.

Mein Eisbock Barrique welcomes you with an intense raspberry, cherry and vanilla aroma. A very rich and harmonious taste of chocolate, vanilla and berries will explode in your mouth leaving a lasting and pleasant after-taste reminding you of good red wine.

This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.",

After benumbing a thick and malty doppelbock for days, we mined the resulting colossal chunks of ice from the vat to extract the pesky water obstructing the full potential of this deliciously decadent libation. Its thick and creamy mouthfeel is interlaced with a prevalent chocolaty richness that seductively satiates.

You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. \"The Goat Gland Doctor.\" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals. Some farmers are even said to have brought along there own goats because they felt them to have superior sexual prowess.",

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience.",

The flavor that develops on the palate is well-rounded and malty with a hint of nutmeg and fine nougat. The sparkling nature of ERDINGER Pikantus harmonizes perfectly with its slightly sweet character, as well as its soft and delicate finish.",

It is a classic, top-fermented, golden yellow strong beer, which is fermented traditionally in the bottle. The foam is particularly fine-pored, very stable and creamy. In appearance, one finds a strong golden-yellow color with beautiful, natural haziness. The smell is fruity, with a trace of banana flavor. In the first sip, this beer specialty is balanced, full-bodied, sparkling and rounded - the malt character is balanced and aromatic. In the aftertaste, it is very mild and makes you want another sip, especially so on cold winter days.",

Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.",

At that point, some facets of the Brett characteristics will have mellowed, while others will have become more profound; it all matures into a fascinating and delicious culmination.

In these barrels—beer experts suppose—some ales were naturally inoculated with Brettanomyces, a form of wild yeast. Brett IPA plays off this piece of brewing lore by pairing Brettanomyces—a yeast that exhibits itself as ripe fruit rather than strong funk or sourness—with multiple varieties of fruit-forward hops.Aromas of citrus, pineapple, and passion fruit meld into tropical flavors that pair nicely with the beer’s lightly hopped body. Maris Otter, Munich malts, and raw wheat balance the floral barrage of Bravo, Cascade, Amarillo, Centennial, Citra, and Galaxy hops. By finishing with a mix of pleasant bitterness and tropical fruit, Brett IPA ushers brewing history into the present.",

A further 18 months of secondary fermentation and additional maturation in French and American oak barrels creates unparalleled depth and complexity. This hefty brew is brimming with a full spectrum of flavors and aromas: Nutty sherry aromas mingle with Oak, then give way to a Cointreau-like boozy orange zest. Tart cherries linger as the acidity builds on the palate. Vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon provide a supporting cast. The whole experience is reminiscent of a Manhattan cocktail.

    "Description": "Notes:When Anthony Yoerg came to the United States from Bavaria, the brewing scene was in its infancy and British styled ales dominated production. But Anthony had a different way of making beer. When he first began in Saint Paul, he aged his beer in caves, lagering them for four weeks before he released them to the public. The end result was a smoother, silkier and much more drinkable style of beer.100% steam-brewed, just as it was over 150 years ago, using 100% Minnesota Barley (three different toast levels), Washington State Hops, and a touch of Celeia Hops for aromatics. Yoerg's Beer is a big, malty, roasty/toasty brew with a haunting dance of hops in the background, It's fragrant, powerful, and just might be the most serious lager to come out of the Midwest since, well, since The Yoerg Brewing Company closed their doors in 1952.",

As per the analysis, Dogfish Head's Theobroma (translated into \"food of the gods\") is brewed with Aztec cocoa powder and cocoa nibs (from our friends at Askinosie Chocolate), honey, chilies and annatto (fragrant tree seeds).It's light in color, not what you expect from your typical chocolate beer (not that you'd be surpised that we'd do something unexpected with this beer!).8 IBU",

For our homage to Jersey's breakfast beverage, we teamed up with our neighbors at Fair Mountain Coffee Roasters looking for an elevated version of classic crappy coffee. We chose Mexican Chiapas for its bitterness akin to artichoke, roasting it a little darker than usual, along with Ethiopian Sidamo for its pleasant lemon-like acidity, which we pushed up through fermentation. We added this coffee blend to a high gravity golden cream ale, contributing our \"milk and 2 sugars.\" Drink Regular Coffee because running over a black beer with coffee is no way to get to work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AtZGKBsd94&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg",

You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.",

We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell.",

Biere de Noel, which translates as “Christmas Beer”, tends to exhibit a more malty profile than a typical Biere de Garde.In its native France this special type of ale is brewed by just a handful of small breweries and is only available for the few weeks leading up to Christmas.",

Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.",

When they ran out of beer they still didn't want to go outside so they decided it would be better if they just started brewing their beer in the sauna. And so began the tradition of brewing this traditional Finnish beer in saunas. Chock full of rye and juniper and spicy yeast esters, our sahti might inspire you to build your own sauna to ride out this winter.20 IBU",

    "Description": "Notes:SAHATI is our interpretation of traditional Finnish sahti. Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property, we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year. SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves.",

You could call it fate, but they called it Tank 7, and so it is. Beginning with a big surge of fruity aromatics and grapefruit-hoppy notes, the flavor of this complex, straw-colored ale tapers off to a peppery, dry finish.38 IBU",

Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.",

With flavors of fresh berries and rye, Soft Parade finishes dry and eminently drinkable.Soft Parade was originally developed because Joe Short wanted to create a beer that incorporated a medley of berries, had a great color, and appealed to wine drinkers. The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short’s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade. That day the beer was named!",

The vessel, made of birch bark, was found in the tomb of a leather‐clad woman Dr. Pat says was probably an upper-class dancer or priestess. The analysis pointed to the ingredients used in this unique brew: wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, myrica gale, yarrow, honey and birch syrup.The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness. While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs.",

Our destination is 9,000 years ago, in Northern China! Preserved pottery jars found in the Neolithic villiage of Jiahu, in Henan province, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey and fruit was being produced that long ago, right around the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East!Fast forward to 2005. Molecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology calls on Dogfish Head to re-create another ancient beverage, and Chateau Jiahu is born.In keeping with historic evidence, Dogfish brewers use brown rice syrup, orange blossom honey, muscat grape, barley malt and hawthorn berry. The wort is fermented for about a month with sake yeast until the beer is ready for packaging.10 IBU",

The hoppy citrus aroma complements the ingredients that make this beer so unique: lemon and lime peel, Kaffir lime leaves, and lemongrass provide an subtle yet unmistakeable floral nose and just a touch of bracing tartness, taking the refreshment of Swelter to the next level.",

It's led us to craft many an IPA, most of them imperial—some intense for their time and all timeless in their intensity. For Stone Go To IPA, we embrace our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance of lupulin-borne bitterness into a \"session\" IPA that delivers all the fruity, piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employ \"hop bursting,\" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness. The result is an alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the glory of the almighty hop.",

Food. 7 days of family, community, and bagels (beer!), called, Shiva, meaning \"7\" in Hebrew. The flip side to the 7 days of Creation with the 7th as a holy day of rest.

So while many thought it was an April Fool's joke when we announced Rouge, a Brut IPA blended with Pinot Noir juice and dedicated to typos, we knew it was real and it was spectacular. The label is an anagram of our name: Rogue. And it's been the most common misspelling of our brand since day one.We can't count the times we've received phone calls for a \"Rouge Alés\" and we relish the opportunity to recount that one time our brewer's yeast was accidentally delivered to the gentleman's lounge, Club Rouge in Portland instead of Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery. Heck, we've even been guilty of misspelling our own name once or twice. It's such a common gaffe, we've even given it a term: \"getting rouged.\"After 30 years of \"getting Rouged,\" we felt it was time to embrace our rougey roots and brew something delicious in honor of it.Rogue Innovation Brewer Michael King started with a brut IPA, a dry but aromatic example of the IPA style, combining 2-Row Malt, Corn Flakes and Rolled Oats. For hops, he selected Mosaic, Chinook, El Dorado, Strata, Rogue Farms Alluvial. He of course used our proprietary Pacman Yeast and Newport's own Free Range Coastal Water. And for a real Rogue (Rouge?) twist on it all, he blended it with Oregon Pinot Noir juice.The result is a crisp and semi-dry brut IPA co-fermented with Oregon Pinot Noir juice for a unique flavor and an added rouge hue. The finish is hoppy and delicious.",

So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU",

A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever.

Hop bitterness is not particularly intense, which leads to a very drinkable, New England IPA even non-IPA fans love. The Haze is not from yeast, but rather from an interplay of lipids from the malted oat and oils and acids which naturally occur in the hand selected Dry hops. This beer is a perfect interplay between top grade malt and hops, MI water and brewing technique which cannot be faked.Hops aren't cheap, but M-43 is worth every penny!65 IBU",

It is brewed with lightly roasted malt and 100% German Noble Hops: Perle for bitterness and Hallertau Traditional for flavor and aroma.In 1918, the term Kölsch was used to describe the ale brewed in Köln, a city on the Rhine River in western Germany. The style began to rise in popularity in the 1960s and now, many American craft brewers brew variations of the style, labeling it a golden ale. Our Kölsch is unique to the Schlafly brewery because Ulrike, a native of Köln and wife of brewery co-founder Tom Schlafly, connected Schlafly Beer with the Gaffel Brewery of Köln.

It wasn’t long before Old Style became Chicago’s beer – served from the North Side to the South Side and everywhere in between. Being accepted as a true local, Old Style began sponsoring the Chicago Cubs in 1950. With Old Style still being served at Wrigley Field today, the partnership is one of longest standing in the country.In 2009, Old Style revived the centuries-old German brewing tradition called “Kraeusening.” This double fermentation process increases carbonation and richness, ultimately leading to a better tasting beer that has since been won medals at the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup.",

Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.",

This truly unique brew takes two active fermentations and blends them together to create a deliciously harmonious result. This process delivers a distinct flavor that showcases the slight fruitiness of an ale with the balanced drinkability and smoothness of a lager. Sam ’76 will surprise any craft beer lover with its huge flavor and aroma along with a light-bodied, refreshing crispness. At just 4.7% ABV, this brew is perfect for those sessionable occasions. Cascade, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and Galaxy hops impart a tropical citrus aroma that gives way to a bright, juicy citrus hop flavor but without the hop bitterness. The brewers have been experimenting for over a year, tested over 60 iterations with multiple combinations of 12 different hop varieties in the nano brewery in Boston in order to perfect the Sam ’76 recipe.12 IBU",

A laborious mashing and conditioning process yields a complex texture and malt profile.Nomad pours a nearly pitch black in the glass. Through extended, natural conditioning, not a hint of haze remains. An aggressive pour yields a thick and billowing head that clings to the side of the glass as you work your way through the pour. It is the most appealing looking beer we have made in recent memory. We taste mild chocolate, brown bread, hay, and earthy noble hops. It goes down remarkably easy while leaving a pleasant and lingering impression on your palate. The mark of a great beer is the ease in which it drinks in conjunction with potent, appealing, and incisive flavors. To that end, we are extraordinarily proud to offer Nomad to you for your enjoyment. I’m not sure if there is another beer we will collectively drink more of this autumn at Tree House.",

The German Noble hop, Mittelfrüh, lends a mild lemony, spicy flavor.The German word “Helles” translates as “light” and “Lager” means “to store”. This beer style emerged in Germany through the Spaten Brewery’s marriage of British, Bohemian and German brewing techniques. This style is an integral part of brewing history and a predecessor of the straw-colored, light-bodied beers which are the most widely consumed beers in the world today. The lager yeast ferments the beer more slowly and at lower temperatures; it is then stored for maturation. This results in a beer which is more smooth and drinkable. Today, many American craft brewers offer this style as a maltier and hoppier alternative to American light lagers.17 IBU",

To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an \"IPA style\" beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior, in this case, because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer.

    "Description": "Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste. ABV 4.9-5.2% (Depends on package type and location)IBU 20SRM 4",

As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.",

Through high-profile partnerships with actor Billy Dee Williams and comedian Redd Foxx — who both appeared in radio, print, and TV advertisements – Colt 45 established itself as the premier malt liquor beverage by the early 1970s.It was also during this time that the iconic slogan, “Works Every Time,” became synonymous with the brand. The Williams relationship lasted for nearly four decades, until he passed the torch to music mogul, Snoop Dogg in 2010.With Snoop at the helm, we’ve entered an exciting new Colt 45 era.",

    "Description": "Notes:Dunkel” means dark, and our Dunkel copies the traditional brown Munich lager that was the most widely drunk beer in Bavaria at the turn of the 20th Century. Dunkel is made from amber colored Munich malt. Germans approach dark beer from a different direction than their Belgian and British neighbors. Instead of using a small amount of high-color, dark-roasted or caramelized malt, Germans use a lot of low or medium color malt that avoids the acrid bitter roastiness or burnt sugar flavors found in stouts and porters. Dunkel is a medium -bodied beer with a slightly sweet, toasted bread crust malt flavor and smooth finish accentuated with just enough noble bitterness to balance the malt.18 IBU",

This rich, amber lager is balanced by the use of German noble hops, while the lager yeast ferments cold and slow, creating a smooth, crisp beer.Märzen, or Oktoberfest, has its origins in Bavaria, most likely before the 16th century. For public safety and brewing quality concerns, the Bavarian Brauordnung was decreed in 1539, stating that beer could only be brewed from September 29th (Saint Michael) to April 23rd (Saint George). Over the summer months, beers were stored, or lagered, in caves and stone cellars. The evolution of Oktoberfest came from the last brews of the year, in March (or Märzen), as these beers would be ready to drink for the Bavarian celebration, “Oktoberfest”.25 IBU",

And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned \"Kräusen\" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier. The result is an unfiltered, bottom fermented and amber color Märzen Lager hybrid with a vibrant and slightly smoky flavor.IBU: 30",

    "Description": "Notes:5 O’Clock Shadow Double Black Lager is brewed in the German Schwarzbier (black beer) tradition. Schwarzbier is to lager what stout or porter is to ale. Like those dark British beers, Schwarzbier has long been considered nourishing and even curative. German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with noble hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.This German lager pours a deep brown, almost black color with ruby highlights. It has soft dark chocolate notes with hints of caramel and a light roasty finish.38 IBU",

The style enjoyed a heyday in St. Louis in the late 1800s, but large scale production of dark lagers failed to resurface after Prohibition. In 2007, the beer community of St. Louis honored St. Louis Dark Lager as the official beer of the inaugural St. Louis Brewers Heritage Festival, an annual tasting event that celebrates the many breweries thriving in St. Louis today.﻿45 IBU",

This guarantees flour of a very high quality, from a totally natural environment.Highly fermentable, chestnut flour has an excellent impact on the quality of the head and gives beer its beautiful coloring. Mixed into the malt during the mashing process, the chestnut flour is a prime ingredient and not just a flavoring.This recipe, unique in the world, gives PIETRA its conflicting taste accentuating a lingering subtle bitterness.Powerful and delicate, robust and smooth, Pietra has a 6% alcohol content.

To offset this acidity, some decided to add sugar to it. Thus faro was born. Adding sugar syrup to lambic was a revelation at the time of Bruegel. (Some even argue that without faro, Bruegel would have been deprived of inspiration and would have remained an ordinary amateur painter whose canvases couldn't even have been sold at a flea market.) Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion. It was not until 1978 that our family brought it back to centre stage. Or centre Senne, as you prefer.

Today, Timmermans Faro is still brewed using the methods and recipes of days gone by, and meets with unanimous approval.",

Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.",

In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU",

Since real Schaerbeek cherries are scarce, Lindemans Brewery has found their perfect equivalence elsewhere in Europe. It is deep red in colour and its foam head is slightly pink. Very refreshing, this beverage is a perfect thirst-quencher which, thanks to its fizzy and tangy flavour, is ideal as an aperitif.In order to produce the Oude Kriek Cuvée René, the cherries ferment in lambic that is at least six months old in huge 10,000-litre oak barrels called foudres. After six months, this traditional kriek is bottled in corked 75 cl bottles. The beer will then undergo a spontaneous second fermentation process which, after a few months, will produce the carbon dioxide (CO2) to which this authentic beer owes its carbonation and distinctive foam head.",

But kept in a cellar for a few years, it becomes truly exceptional!The use of a champagne bottle dates back to an uncertain time period when lambic brewers specialized in recovering empty bottles from great restaurants and other establishments where a lot of champagne was consumed. That is why we chose the most noble of bottles to hold our noblest beer.",

During the cooling process, naturally occurring microflora from the air inoculates the beer, and in the morning, it is transferred into French oak wine barrels where the entire fermentation and aging takes place. Coolship Resurgam is a blend of this one-, two-, and three-year old spontaneously fermented beer. The finished beer has aromas of apricot, lemon zest, and candied fruit. Notes of tropical fruit and flavors of funk lead to a clean, tart, and dry finish.Coolship Resurgam is a blend of both old and young unfruited spontaneous beer. The name comes from the motto of our fair city, Portland, Me. It means \"I shall rise again\". Coolship Resurgam won a Silver medal at the 2010 GABF.a blend of this one-, two-, and three-year old spontaneously fermented beer. The finished beer has aromas of apricot, lemon zest, and candied fruit. Notes of tropical fruit and flavors of funk lead to a clean, tart and dry finish.",

This geuze has fermented in the bottle and will continue to develop its tastes and aromas over its long life when properly cellared.

This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.",

The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called \"cold hopping\", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.",

After a mechanical breakdown, 3 Fonteinen Brewery of Beersel (possibly the best Lambic blender in the world) had economic damage in the summer of 2009. The news caused such a stir in the International beer movement that I called Armand to know how things were. As he needed to sell his Lambic, I immediately got inspired to blend our New Morning with his beer. We selected three 18 month old Lambic barrels that we siphoned in a small tank on our truck. The journey back was long and hard, myself and Manuel took turns driving through Belgium, France and Italy only stopping for gas. After days hand bottling and months of maturation, the outcome has gone over and beyond our expectations and we can say with pride that it was worth it! 14°",

    "Description": "Notes:First released in 1997, Fuller's Vintage Ale is brewed in limited batches with each bottle being numbered. It can be enjoyed immediately, or Fuller's recommends laying the beer down to enjoy when it peaks in 3 to 4 years and consume at cellar temperature. And though it's released each year as a separate vintage, BA has been informed that the recipe is only slightly tweaked from year to year, while the ABV remains at 8.5%.As the new Head Brewer, this 2017 edition of Vintage Ale champions a new American hop variety Denali, used to give the beer a citrusy, pine-like flavour and a new British malt variety Laureate. Combined with trusty British hops Target and Goldings, our 21st Vintage Ale is a well-rounded and balanced beer wilh Fuller's yeast adding the orange, marmalade characters to it. Vinlage ale is an exceptional beer, only available from Fuller's as a limited release of individually packaged and numbered bottles and will improve for many years to come, like a fine wine or whisky. As the beer is bottle conditioned it will form a natural sediment, so pour carefully, sit back and enjoy the very finest of Fuller's ales.",

This unique, beautiful brew is often imitated but never matched and is sold literally all over the world. With countless awards to its credit, it is something of which every Briton can be very proud and is the epitome of the greatest of British brewing tradition.In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.",

After more than a century of failing to repel these seafaring raiders in their anachronistic wooden ships, despite access to modern sea, land and air arsenals that ostensibly should make short work of wind powered vessels equipped with naught but cast iron cannons and raging scurvy, it occurred to the folks of Cigar City Brewing that if you can’t beat them start saying Arrrr Matey! And so we have brewed Invasion Pale Ale. With tropical notes of mango and tangerine imparted by Simcoe and Mosaic hops, this crisp and sessionable Pale Ale is a perfect companion for long days of marauding, pillaging, and pirating.",

The end result? A refreshingly hopped pale-ish ale with a huge citrus burst!The man bent over his guitar, a shearsman of sorts. The day was green. They said, 'You have a blue guitar, you do not play things as they are.' The man replied, 'Things as they are / Are changed upon the blue guitar.' And they said then, 'But play, you must, a tune beyond us, yet ourselves, a tune upon the blue guitar of things exactly as they are.' He sighs, I cannot bring a world quite round, although I patch it as I can. I sing a hero's head, large eye and bearded bronze, but not a man, although I patch him as I can and reach through him almost to man. If to serenade almost to man is to miss, by that, things as they are, say it is the serenade of a man that plays a blue guitar...\" These, the words of the Conjurer-in-Chief; Wallace Stevens, describe in perfect detail the work of a brewer as he sits to write a new recipe. Perfection is the goal, to fill a desire for a perfect beer. Yet the instrument of his mind and that of the brewhouse and yeast are the fallible tools at hand. And so he patches it as he can. A little hop here, a little citrus there, a yeast to marry the two, the worty substrate of reality calling the key and time signature. The beer that comes will be the beer we drink, the beer whose story we will tell here. The brewer does what he can and imagines a world quite round. Conjurer-in-Chief Stevens concludes; \"Exceeding music must take the place of empty heaven and its hymns.\" What does it all have to do with beer?",

The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.",

Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.25 IBU",

The recipe is based on the traditional and beloved Pilsner Urquell, which is why we have chosen not to filter our beer and why our lagering time is as long as it is--from brewday to when we can or keg Pils it is at least eight weeks. Our Pilsner is a little more golden, rounder, and a little more malt driven than many other versions. The beer possesses strong hop character that is balanced by its rich, round, malty palate.

In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.",

We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRNXQnMTAg&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg",

However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too!

Colonists used pumpkin and squash as the fermenting medium, since malted barley was scarce. Once malt became more readily available, it replaced these alternatives to grain. In the 1990’s, American craft brewers reintroduced the style to the delight of pumpkin beer drinkers.16 IBU",

Suddenly a British Navy sloop surprised them. The drunken pirates hid below deck, leaving Captain Jack’s mistresses Anne Bonney and Mary Read to defend the ship. The women shared a reputation as “fierce hell cats,” but the British Navy eventually overtook the pirate ship. Captain Jack and the pirates were sentenced to hang. Anne visited her lover in his cell before his execution, and instead of loving words her scathing comments live on throughout history, “Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang’d like a dog.” Their legacy inspired us to brew an equally ferocious Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed with pirate rum spices.

    "Description": "Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.ABV varies by batch",

To celebrate the rebirth of dragons, three different labels were created by the Game of Thrones visual effects specialists, each depicting one of Daenerys' feared dragons. Randomly distributed amongst the cases, each case will contain all three bottles.On sale March 31, in time for the debut of Season 4, Fire and Blood makes for the perfect season premiere pairing. The beer is available in 750ml bottles and 1/6 barrel kegs.Fire & Blood is a 6.8% ABV Red ale, brewed with pilsner, Cara-60, Midnight Wheat, flaked rye and spelt. Assertive hopping includes CTZ, Styrian Golding and German Tettnang hops. Spiced with de-seeded Ancho chilies. Fire & Blood has a deep, dark red hue with a persistent, creamy, off-white head. Aromas of ripe fruit, raisins, malt & slight spice, followed by a slightly floral and spicy hop character. A fruity, sweetish malt taste gives way to faint drying provided by the hops & rye.",

Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered. The result is a satisfying brew full of flavor with a remarkably clean and smooth finish.",

Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. Check ‘em out: Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!",

As we all know (or should know) Chiquen refers to anything that is not chicken.Now that we have all that straight, we will talk about what is in this beer. Brewed with Maris Otter from the UK and rye malt and caramel rye from Germany, imparting a spicy, fruity and dry flavor. Then hopped with enough English Nugget and Kent Goldings just to balance and fermented with our house ale yeast. After fermentation we moved the entire batch into the AtG private dining room and into used Redemption Rye barrels from our good friends at Strong's Spirits. There it aged for 5 weeks until we felt it had picked up the right amount of residual bourbon character and oak flavors. We then transferred it to our serving tank, carbonated it and the end result is on tap now, a balanced drinkable and complex barrel aged beer.",

This fusion is hazy orange-amber in colour, with a well-constructed white head. It begins with an up front citrus aroma followed by a complex malt body with a hint of peppery rye which releases earthy floral British hop flavour on the finish.It is made of a combination of seven different floral British and pungent American hops, some which are added in a dry hopping process. This involves adding hops directly to the fermented beer in the fermenter. The hops are well supported by a large malt bill of five character malts with a generous portion of rye which contributes to mouth feel and Cameron’s Rye Pale Ale’s own special character.",

    "Description": "Notes:Here at Brooklyn Brewery, we are, of course, beer people. But we are also “drinks people,” and many inspirations come to us out of the deep and wondrous world of cocktails. While surely invented earlier, the modern cocktail emerged in the 19th century. The original—the ur-cocktail, if you will—was the Old Fashioned. A deceptively simple drink consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters (stirred, not shaken), usually with a bit of citrus peel, a good Old Fashioned remains a thing of austere beauty. By the 1860s, some bartenders, Jerry Thomas (aka \"The Professor\") chief among them, became household names in America. A mixologist (believe it or not, the moniker is actually old) looking to make a name for himself would often make a change to an existing cocktail, perhaps adding absinthe, or curaçao, or a dash of maraschino liqueur. This new version would be rakishly referred to as “improved,” as the upstart barman fervently hoped to eclipse his predecessor.Well, we’ve gone this idea one better. We have “improved” the Old Fashioned by making it into a beer. Witness our strong rye beer, suffused with various spices and peels! Wonder at its long blissful rest in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey oak barrels! Marvel at its clever infusions of bitter gentian root and enticing botanicals! And then enjoy, as you are greeted by the silky spice of rye, the firm herbal bitterness, the brightness of citrus, and the sweet warmth of oak. Sit in your favorite chair, surround yourself with your favorite people, and imbibe this, our latest Brooklyn Quarterly Experiment. We can nearly guarantee that you shall feel that your day has, in fact, improved.Style: Barrel-aged rye ale with botanicals & bittersMalts: Glen Eagle Maris Otter, Canadian 2-row, Weyermann Rye, Fawcett Rye, Fawcett Crystal RyeAdditions: Demerara sugar, Belgian candi syrup, bitter orange peel, lemon peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, bitter gentian root, cloves, and aging in WhistlePig Rye whiskey barrelsHops: PerleYeast: Our House Ale YeastOriginal Gravity: 21° Plato",

    "Description": "Notes:Équinoxe du Printemps (French for \"spring equinox\") is the quintessential marriage of two great traditions: beer brewing in Scotland, and maple syrup production in Quebec. At the first draught, the mouth is overcome by woody, malty flavours, sustained by a discrete touch of sweetness. The aftertaste brings about the flavours of maple, which are sufficiently present to be appreciated, but never overwhelming the typical flavours of a Scotch Ale. Equinoxe du printemps is brewed only once a year in January. It is aged for two months in order to attain a perfect balance in taste. Then, it is sold starting March 21st, until stocks last.The Equinoxe du printemps was born in our Montreal brewpub in February 1999.",

It is brewed using only oak-smoked wheat malt and assertively hopped like a pilsner. Even with a low ABV, the wheat malt delivers a full-bodied beer.

It has a light body from the wheat and refreshingly tart acidity that make it a perfect summer thirst-quencher. Its lemony tartness is provided by a secondary fermentation with lactobacillus, the same microorganism that’s responsible for yogurt’s tang. That tartness increases and improves with age, so the people of Berlin are known to buy extra bottles to bury in their gardens for two years or more.As usual with our Cellar Reserves, we’ve taken a traditional style and added our own twist. In this case we’ve tripled the strength over the traditional beer, which should only increase its aging potential. For the primary fermentation we used a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen yeast that produces soft notes of banana and clove. We followed that with lactobacillus and six months in conditioning to create a complex fruity acidity that compliments the soft sweet malt tones and a unique ale that is both fulfilling and refreshing.15 IBU",

Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish. Altogether a pretty unique yet very drinkable beer.",

After the main fermentation and the second lagering the \"Vichtenaar\" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The \"Vichtenaar\" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the \"Vichtenaar\" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the \"Vichtenaar\" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The \"Vichtenaar\" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur. In 1958 “Brewery Verhaeghe” obtained for its beer \"Vichtenaar\" the first prize in the international contest for beers in Ghent.",

About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer.

It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries. Intense amber colour with ruby reflections, extraordinary aromatic complexity: fruity aromas (marasca and morello cherries in the first place), accompanied by subtle ethereal notes and sublime acetic hints and lactic acid, as well as shades of oxidized malts. In the mouth it is tasty, large, persistent, and ends with a magnificent and uplifting acidity.",

Hun Hunahpu’s corpse morphed into a cacao tree, his head becoming a cacao pod, which in typically awesome mythology fashion, spit upon the hand of a young maiden named Xiquic who promptly became pregnant with the hero twins. The twins would ultimately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun.

It is black in color with a very clean finish and moderate hop flavor. While the porter style was developing, some brewers produced a stout porter and over time generated a new style known simply as stout. These beers traditionally contain a distinct roasted malt flavor and can run the gamut from a dry stout, such as Guinness to a sweet stout such as Watney’s Cream Stout. Our Black Mocha falls in the sweet stout range and derives its chocolate and coffee tones from the use of appropriate roasted malt grains and is very often used as an after dinner libation or an accompaniment to dessert.",

Rich heady chocolate on the nose, it’s all about deep luscious stouty goodness throughout with a soft mouthfeel. Just as a coffee bitterness develops, and you’re thinking that the party’s over, a subtle dry heat arrives that not only leaves your mouth tingling, but also thirsty and gasping for another taste. The Mayans smoked their chillis, and rather than brew with smoked malt, which can add to the bitterness, we used freshly smoked dried chipotle chillis to add an extra layer of flavour.",

While our Old School Stout isn't exactly strong in alcohol (5.5% ABV), it is very much a rich full bodied Ale dominated by chocolate and roasted malt flavours and very well balanced. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley, just one of the six malts in our Old School Stout recipe. A subtle bitterness leads to a long creamy finish on this aphotic beauty.",

His stout recipe laid the foundation for how we would brew for the next 200 years.The same year Benjamin brewed his lovely dark beer, we shipped the first barrels of Guinness to America. To this day, America’s favorite stouts are still brewed at St. James’s Gate. Based on the Guinness brewing logs of 1817, Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout seeks to bring to life the same dark ruby red color and complex flavor of Benjamin’s beer from 200 years ago. Rich and full-bodied with notes of caramel, toffee and sweet chocolate. Smooth-drinking with just the right amount of bitterness. Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout carries on the legacy of 1817 and looks forward to our next 200 years in America.",

The richness of the grain blend is balanced by the nutty character of the roasted malt, the creaminess from the oatmeal flakes and a dose of hops.Before the 19th century, all barley was malted over wood-fired kilns and the resulting dark roasted malt defined the browns, porters, and stouts of England. Near the end of the 19th century, brewers had introduced oats for their purported restorative and nourishing characteristics, producing beers such as oatmeal stout and milk stout. By the 1950’s, Oatmeal Stout had nearly trickled out of existence. Following the beer’s literary rebirth in the articles of English beer writer Michael Jackson in the 1970’s, British and American craft brewers are once again promoting the style.40 IBU",

This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon \"Russian Imperial Stout\" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.",

Opaque black in color, with notes of espresso, chocolate, dark toffee and hints of backstrap molasses. The English hop varietals provide a subtle herbal dryness, and finishes with a hearty slap of roasty espresso. Pair Marshal Zhukov’s with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.We brew and release Zhukov's in the summer knowing that a beer of this heft reaches its full potential a few months after release. So save a bottle for the cold winter!80 IBU",

Such were the final days of the old empire. Reactionary, decadent, sputnik, stroganoff, weird, and drunk. But even as the proletariat countryside labored under inhuman conditions and the threat of being sent to a futile war in the east, they wisely took the time to slam back an Imperial Stout or two. After all, life can be a real 'suka' as they said in the old country. Big, black, bourgeois, Bolshoi, belligerent, buxom, and scary.

This one is definitely on the dark side.A play on Josh's name, this Russian imperial stout is aged in two different types of bourbon barrels (Heaven Hill & Old Forester) then blended for the resulting thick and dark brew.Deth's Tar is a barrel-aged Russian Imperial Oatmeal Stout. It is brewed with a host of wonderful specialty malts, flaked oats and oat malt to impart a rich, silky mouthfeel and deep, complex malt flavors and aromas reminiscent of dark baker’s chocolate, fresh brewed coffee and caramel candy. We also utilized Warrior as the main bittering hop and English Fuggle in the whirlpool to impart a clean balanced bitterness and hints earthiness and spiciness dancing around the intense malt backbone. The brew then spent seven months resting between Heaven Hill and Old Forester bourbon barrels. The resulting blend is Deth's Tar, that we bring to you once again on draft and in 22-ounce bombers in commemorative packaging.40 IBU",

We took the ingredients in bourbon whiskey (Barley, Rye, Corn) and then smoked them with cherry wood and brewed a huge imperial stout with them.

However, for fans of the original Black Metal, or “O.G. Black Metal” as its known, we feel as though we need to borrow the famous line from Stone Brewing Co.‘s Arrogant Bastard Ale: “You probably won’t like it.” Like all our beer, the flavors and aromas of the current batch of Black Metal are very much fermentation derived and rely far less on copious amounts of malt and hops. This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well. There will be those that don’t, however, and wish we’d return to the days of fermenting this beer with English ale yeast, and that’s OK.",

This English-style milk stout, originally a limited-edition offering at Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens - Liberty Station, proved the perfect foil for beans from San Diego-based Ryan Bros Coffee. The bitterness of the coffee is balanced out brilliantly by the milk sugar we used to add a touch of sweetness and creaminess to the stout’s smooth, easy-drinking texture. Cheers to the coalescence of two highly artisanal (and delectable) mediums.",

Just the right chocolate was essential. Elbow recommended a rare variety from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma, and a personal favorite. More than a mere flavoring, the chocolate — in the form of nibs, or crushed, roasted beans – was incorporated into the brewing process itself.24 IBU",

It's as tasty and complex as a fine red wine.In the Quick Sip Clip video, Sam talks about Raison D'Etre inside the new cellars for our 600-bbl fermentation tanks. The cellars were designed specifically to allow sterile yeast management. The system also allows us to automatically dose the yeast into the fermentation tanks.

    "Description": "Notes:UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU",

The first sip reveals a harmonious symphony of carefully selected wheat and barley malts with exquisite Hallertau aroma hops. The taste buds detect hints of caramel, nuts and fresh bread. An unmistakable top-fermenting accent is provided by ERDINGER’s traditional yeast.ERDINGER Dunkel first saw the light of day in 1989, when ERDINGER’s master brewers created a dark wheat beer as a birthday present for the private brewery’s owner, Werner Brombach. He liked it so much that he decided to put it on the market in 1990.",

The top-fermented, yeasty taste sensation is unmistakable. This beer is rich in sparkle and has just a touch of a special bitter quality.

Then there’s the opalescence and fine structure of the yeast turbidity. At the same time, the creamy, fine pored head invites you to get to know this light Weissbier from the Holy Mountain. You’ll need two takes to enjoy the aromas to the full.First, distinctive fruity aromas like banana and honeydew melon come to the fore, followed by fine cloves. Andechser Weissbier Hell is a very tangy, refreshing treat with the conviction of a full, soft body. It concludes on a finely balanced interplay of light sweet honey and a delicate acidity with undertones of bitter hoppiness that quickly subside into a harmonious aftertaste.A Weissbier that embodies a slice of the Andechs lifestyle: finely yeasty, tangy, and sparkling, it refreshes and renews the thirst for more",

    "Description": "Notes:Our Hefeweizen is a light, unfiltered wheat beer, often served with a wedge of lemon. Made with thirty percent American winter wheat, Hefeweizen is balanced with sweet golden malted barley and Tettnang hops from Oregon that evoke a hint of spice. The American ale yeast is subtle, but the grains take center stage and, when left in the unfiltered beer, gives it that classic cloudiness and additional body.The German Hefeweizen (say “hay-fuh-vite-sin”) traces its history to 16th century Bavaria and eventually came to America with the wave of German immigrants in the 19th century. Although the rise of light lager beer diminished the sales of wheat beers on both sides of the Atlantic, the sale of wheat beers began to rise after WWII, especially in Southern Germany where a unique ale yeast strain fermented the beer with banana and clove esters. In the late 20th Century, the new American craft brewers sought out a lighter style to complement their beer selection and brewed Hefeweizens with the same yeast strains they used to brew their Pale Ales and Stouts.16 IBU",

    "Description": "Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.",

In 2016, we brewed a beautiful little sunset colored beer to age in French oak to be later finished on Pluots and in March of 2018, we released our first collaboration with Brad, Pitter Patter.Brad came back to town for that release, and while here, we brewed this release, Maple In The Wood - a maple bourbon and bourbon barrel-aged wheatwine. We used the flavor profiles and took inspiration from our respective barleywines, but infused the recipes with copious amounts of malted white wheat. In the kettle, we added a large percentage of Vermont maple syrup. We then aged this wheatwine in BLiS maple bourbon and E.H. Taylor bourbon barrels for 18 months before selecting a blend that showcased the barrels and the individual threads in a harmonious, cohesive way.The result is a luxurious, round, rich, beer that lays the groundwork and structure for the barrels to rest. The maple leaves a nuanced hint of sweetness that melds with the notes of bourbon, caramel, toffee, and dark fruits from the blend of yeasts we used to ferment before allowing it to age and mature in oak to softness and balance. Although it’s a big beer - like most of our barrel-aged beers - the wheat lightens the experience and allows it to fall somewhere between our Längst and Anabasis on the palate.",

Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1.Overall, Positive Contact is characterized by its bright spritzy cider character and autumnal herbal quality derived from the cilantro, cayenne, and yeast.19 IBU",
